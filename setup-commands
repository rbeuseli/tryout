# the following commands were used to create a local repository and upload the
# contents to the empty repository I had just created on github.
# This works using my ssh public key that I upload previously to github.
#
echo "# tryout" >> README.md
git init
git add README.md
git commit -m "first commit"
# the following command (suggested by github) was not actually needed because my
# default branch was already called main due to the setting in my .gitconfig
git branch -M main
git remote add origin git@github.com:rbeuseli/tryout.git
git push -u origin main
